## Categories

### Claim 1
- **Description**: Global warming is not happening.

- **Definition**: Comments with a claim that clearly states that there is no global warming. The claim denies a rise in the Earth's temperature. The claim may instead refer to global cooling and thus makes it clear that there is no global warming.

- **When to use:** Use when there is a reference that the average temperature on earth is not increasing. Or if the comment is reffering to the opposite of global warming, such as cooling.

- **When not to use:**  Do not use if the comment is referring that global warming is happening in natural cycles.

- **Keywords:** 'no climate emergency', 'melting', 'arctic ice', 'arctic sea ice', 'sea level rise', 'extreme weather', 'global cooling', 'greenland ice', 'ice cap', 'arctic ice', 'extreme heat', 'extreme cold'

- **Example:**  "It is global cooling, not warming. CO2 represents 0.04\% of the atmosphere. Ice caps have grown back to almost normal levels, and the planet is green due to the increased concentration of CO2 from 200 to 400 ppl. Storms are less frequent and severe than in the past. So, there is no existential threat to humanity due to the climate itself. But, the poles are shifting, and the earth and galaxy magnetic field and sheet are weaking, thus making us more suceptible to solar radiation (nova). This can trigger a new ice age.”


### Claim 2
- **Description**: Human Greenhouse Gases are not causing global warming.

- **Definition**: Comments with a claim that does not deny the rise in the Earth's temperature, but denies the link between this rise and human activities and emissions. The claim often refers to the fact that greenhouse gases have no effect on the Earth's climate and that the Earth warms solely through natural cycles.

- **When to use:** Use when the comment is reffering that Co2 is not the cause of global warming. And that global warming is happening due to natural causes, as the sun or the vaporizing of the water.

- **When not to use:** When people deny an increase in temperature, and if the refer to Co2 as important for plants, which implies that the impact is not bad.

- **Keywords:** 'natural cycle', 'CO2 is not the cause', 'greenhouse gas', 'no CO2 Greenhouse Effect', 'no effect', 'miniscule effect', 'Man has no control'

- **Example:** “I am a pilot and this guy is brilliant. If you want to know anything about weather,  ask a pilot. We deal with it every day in a way that most people don't realize. I always thought Greenhouse gases aren't a problem.”


### Claim 3
- **Description**: Climate impacts are not bad.

- **Definition**: Comments with a claim that the effects of climate change are not bad. The claim can refer to CO2 being seen as harmless and calling for an increase in CO2 as it is plant food and greening the planet. It also refers to comments claiming that a longer summer is good as it is too cold anyway.

- **When to use:** Apply if comments are reffering to the positive impacts of climate change, such as more Co2 is more food for plants, or higher temperature are good for the agriculture.

- **When not to use:** Do not use if the comment is reffering that extreme weathers are not related to climate change.

- **Keywords:** 'plant food', 'plant growth', 'thrive', 'carbon element is essential', 'average temperature increase', '1 degree', 
'more fossil fuels', 'no co2', 'plant food', 'not pollution', '0.1C', 'ppm', 'not a pollutant'

- **Example:** "Carbon is not pollution, it's plant food. Plant food does not need to be captured. The plants will "capture" it as they see fit and give us oxygen in return. We are far, far, closer to dangerously low levels of plant food than we are to having levels that are too high. You want to see what happens when we run out of plant food? None of us will be around very long to find out."

### Claim 4

- **Description**: Climate solutions won't work.

- **Definition**: Comments with a claim that climate solutions are not efficient and will not work when scaling up. This can refer to technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, or new possibilities like carbon capture.

- **When to use:** Use when comments are reffering to the inefficiency of climate solutions, such as solar panels or windmills. And that fossil fuels and nuclear are the only way to go. That climate change solutions are unrealistic and therefore do not work.

- **When not to use:** Do not use when climate solutions are related to a statment that elites and politicians are exploiting climate solutions to make money.

- **Keywords:** 'green energy', 'renewable energy', 'energy production', 'windmills', 'solar panel'

- **Example:** "Millions of trees are being cut and burned to create power, and 'environmentalists' are ok with that. Solar panels and windmills do not work. So fossil fuels and nuclear are the ONLY way to go. The biggest obstacle is the self-righteous elites who don't care about people."

### Claim 5

- **Description**: Climate movement/science is unreliable.

- **Definition**: Comments with the claim that climate movement/science is unreliable. This can refer to the lack of transparency of climate science, the manipulation of data, or the lack of trust in scientists. It can also refer to the accusation of scientists and activists of being corrupt or having an agenda. Additionally, this claim is appearing when the Contrarian Audience is blaming activists and science in any form.

- **When to use:** Use when comments are reffering to the unreliability of climate science, such as the manipulation of data, or the lack of transparency of climate scientists. Furthermore, when scientist and certain groups are accused of being corrupt or having an agenda. Also if the media is reffered to be unreliable and the are alarmist or hysterics.

- **When not to use:** Do not use if the comment is discussing the economic or policy implications of climate change without questioning the science, or if it is talking about climate change in terms of personal actions or lifestyle changes without implying that the science is unreliable.

- **Keywords:** 'alarmism', 'catastrophist', 'doomsday cult', 'climate hysteric', 'unscientific', 'corrupt politician', 'lie about everything', 'idiocy', 'lunatics', 'Climate Worship', 'Climatists', 'alarmists', 'compliant media', 'climate hysteria', 'climate narrative', 'climate cult', 'scientism', 'climate science myths', 'lying in science', 'climate apocalypse', 'propaganda', 'doomsayers', 'clown show', 'fake climate', 'climate change agenda', 'money made', 'fake news', 'climate terrorists'

- **Example:** "97% of scientists believe in man made climate change. actual percentage is 0.5% They lie about everything."

### Claim 6

- **Description**: Climate change is invented by the global elite.

- **Definition**: Comments on the claim that climate change was invented by the global elite. This can refer to the idea that climate change is a tool of the global elite. The global elite can be defined in different ways, it is not a coherent group but can be made up of political opponents, global corporations, powerful people or international organisations.

- **When to use:** Use when comments are reffering to the idea that climate change is a tool used by the global elite to implement their world view, such as a new world order, or a global government. And that the climate change is a way to control people and make them more dependent on the government.

- **When not to use:** Do not use when the comment is just degrading the political opponent.

- **Keywords:** 'globalist', 'globalist elites', 'elitist', 'global government', 'one world', 'one world government', 'globalism', 'one world utopia', 'new world order', 'enriching themselves', 'saving the planet', 'control over your lives',  'tyranny', 'global elite', 'wef', 'population control'

- **Example:** "The climate scam is just another tool of socialist/ globalist and their Hiegalian dieltic. It was created so they can position their global governance solution. The work that people such as Mr Heller is doing is invaluable, but until we do the real work dismantling the UN/WEF and ridding the education system their influence we will end up living in pods in 15 minute cities, eating bugs and being enslaved with CBDs. And if you think Trump or any other seemingly right wing politicians will save you from this fate you are very nieve."
