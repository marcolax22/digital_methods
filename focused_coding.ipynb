       "      <td>Here's an interesting fact.  Climate data in the US is generally collected at airports.  Why?  Because they are manned 24/7 and must have current and reliable atmospheric data for aircraft operations.  So, great...right?  Well, we are looking at changes in collected climate data.  Changes can be caused by multiple factors.  Let's look at a few.\\n\\nMove the airport.  Denver had its only international Airport within the city limits.  At one mile up in elevation and at the foothills of the Rockies a very particular weather pattern prevailed.  But then the airport was moved.  It is now 20 miles to the east in the grasslands.  Those 20 miles make a very serious impact upon average temps.  The NWS has a page devoted to that fact because they are the Federal organization that collects and aggregates all the climate data.  They point the stark,difference in data due to location change.  Does that matter... yes.  Trends are based upon changes.  So, while temps in Denver proper have stayed the same, the official temp for Denver....from the airport 20 miles away...have increased.  But they haven't.  The temp at that new site has remained relatively stabile.  \\n\\nDevelopment around airports.  Hartsfield Airport Atlanta.  Since it was opened more than 50 years ago, the airport has undergone a massive transformation from a regional airport with some national carrier capacity to one of the busiest airports in the world.  It has also gone from being a literal field airport in the countryside of Atlanta to being a city unto itself with an area of about 35 square miles.  The vast majority of that is treeless and covered in cement and tarmac.  So, this open country airport is now a heat sink exposed to the hot Georgia weather.  Did that cause a massive change in official change in temps recorded at the airport...obviously.  Is that increase getting worse as the airport expands...yes.  \\n\\nThese are the changes that have occurred at just two of the hundreds of official temperature data collection points in the US.  There is no water to correct for the changes.  But they are used to show a trend.  Of course the temps have increased in many locations...but not all...because the collection environment has been altered.  \\n\\nThis is part of the shoddy science being employed in climate research.  Earth's climate could well be changing for reasons that are important.  But without solid data, it is impossible to ever nail down the cause(s).  Without that, we can never select the correct mechanism to address it.  \\nAs an aside, it is known that solar output has increased over the last 3 sunspot cycles.  If that is the actual cause, then we need to know that.  \\n\\nIn the last 15 years, Africa has lost over 260,000 Sq miles of forest due to purposeful deforestation.  That is a land area the size of Texas.  In the previous 15 years it was twice that.  In South America, deforestation has had exactly the same impact.  In Central America, losses over the last 30 years account for 60% of forested area.  Madagascar has seen the massive denuding of the moist temperate east coast.  Desrtification has taken hold.  Rainfall has dropped dramatically.  These are absolutely human induced effects....but by the simple act of clear cutting the forests that kept the climate stabile.  These massive impacts alone are responsible for massive global climate variation.  But there is no discussion of them...what so ever.</td>\n",

       "15615  heres an interesting fact climate data in the us is generally collected at airports why because they are manned 247 and must have current and reliable atmospheric data for aircraft operations so greatright well we are looking at changes in collected climate data changes can be caused by multiple factors lets look at a few move the airport denver had its only international airport within the city limits at one mile up in elevation and at the foothills of the rockies a very particular weather pattern prevailed but then the airport was moved it is now 20 miles to the east in the grasslands those 20 miles make a very serious impact upon average temps the nws has a page devoted to that fact because they are the federal organization that collects and aggregates all the climate data they point the starkdifference in data due to location change does that matter yes trends are based upon changes so while temps in denver proper have stayed the same the official temp for denverfrom the airport 20 miles awayhave increased but they havent the temp at that new site has remained relatively stabile development around airports hartsfield airport atlanta since it was opened more than 50 years ago the airport has undergone a massive transformation from a regional airport with some national carrier capacity to one of the busiest airports in the world it has also gone from being a literal field airport in the countryside of atlanta to being a city unto itself with an area of about 35 square miles the vast majority of that is treeless and covered in cement and tarmac so this open country airport is now a heat sink exposed to the hot georgia weather did that cause a massive change in official change in temps recorded at the airportobviously is that increase getting worse as the airport expandsyes these are the changes that have occurred at just two of the hundreds of official temperature data collection points in the us there is no water to correct for the changes but they are used to show a trend of course the temps have increased in many locationsbut not allbecause the collection environment has been altered this is part of the shoddy science being employed in climate research earths climate could well be changing for reasons that are important but without solid data it is impossible to ever nail down the causes without that we can never select the correct mechanism to address it as an aside it is known that solar output has increased over the last 3 sunspot cycles if that is the actual cause then we need to know that in the last 15 years africa has lost over 260000 sq miles of forest due to purposeful deforestation that is a land area the size of texas in the previous 15 years it was twice that in south america deforestation has had exactly the same impact in central america losses over the last 30 years account for 60 of forested area madagascar has seen the massive denuding of the moist temperate east coast desrtification has taken hold rainfall has dropped dramatically these are absolutely human induced effectsbut by the simple act of clear cutting the forests that kept the climate stabile these massive impacts alone are responsible for massive global climate variation but there is no discussion of themwhat so ever   \n",

       "15615  Here's an interesting fact.  Climate data in the US is generally collected at airports.  Why?  Because they are manned 24/7 and must have current and reliable atmospheric data for aircraft operations.  So, great...right?  Well, we are looking at changes in collected climate data.  Changes can be caused by multiple factors.  Let's look at a few.\\n\\nMove the airport.  Denver had its only international Airport within the city limits.  At one mile up in elevation and at the foothills of the Rockies a very particular weather pattern prevailed.  But then the airport was moved.  It is now 20 miles to the east in the grasslands.  Those 20 miles make a very serious impact upon average temps.  The NWS has a page devoted to that fact because they are the Federal organization that collects and aggregates all the climate data.  They point the stark,difference in data due to location change.  Does that matter... yes.  Trends are based upon changes.  So, while temps in Denver proper have stayed the same, the official temp for Denver....from the airport 20 miles away...have increased.  But they haven't.  The temp at that new site has remained relatively stabile.  \\n\\nDevelopment around airports.  Hartsfield Airport Atlanta.  Since it was opened more than 50 years ago, the airport has undergone a massive transformation from a regional airport with some national carrier capacity to one of the busiest airports in the world.  It has also gone from being a literal field airport in the countryside of Atlanta to being a city unto itself with an area of about 35 square miles.  The vast majority of that is treeless and covered in cement and tarmac.  So, this open country airport is now a heat sink exposed to the hot Georgia weather.  Did that cause a massive change in official change in temps recorded at the airport...obviously.  Is that increase getting worse as the airport expands...yes.  \\n\\nThese are the changes that have occurred at just two of the hundreds of official temperature data collection points in the US.  There is no water to correct for the changes.  But they are used to show a trend.  Of course the temps have increased in many locations...but not all...because the collection environment has been altered.  \\n\\nThis is part of the shoddy science being employed in climate research.  Earth's climate could well be changing for reasons that are important.  But without solid data, it is impossible to ever nail down the cause(s).  Without that, we can never select the correct mechanism to address it.  \\nAs an aside, it is known that solar output has increased over the last 3 sunspot cycles.  If that is the actual cause, then we need to know that.  \\n\\nIn the last 15 years, Africa has lost over 260,000 Sq miles of forest due to purposeful deforestation.  That is a land area the size of Texas.  In the previous 15 years it was twice that.  In South America, deforestation has had exactly the same impact.  In Central America, losses over the last 30 years account for 60% of forested area.  Madagascar has seen the massive denuding of the moist temperate east coast.  Desrtification has taken hold.  Rainfall has dropped dramatically.  These are absolutely human induced effects....but by the simple act of clear cutting the forests that kept the climate stabile.  These massive impacts alone are responsible for massive global climate variation.  But there is no discussion of them...what so ever.   \n",

Climate is affected by so many other factors such as solar flares and the earth's rotational pattern. The earth goes through greenhouse and icehouse cycles. We are currently in the interglacial stage of an ice age where the earth warms. The Marxist elites have no control over climate change. They use carbon dioxide  as a means to gain wealth and power by creating fear through crisis to control people, not climate.   \n",

But, just as this video discusses of 'environmentalist massively upscaling the negatives of fossil fuels', it seems PragerU has extraordinarily upscaled the negatives of 'unreliable solar'. The United States has one of the perfect regions for solar within its territory that could provide enough energy to completely remove fossil fuels altogether with the help of nuclear. This is the Sonoran Desert. \\nThe Sonoran Desert is a large area, with cloudless skies and strong, unblocked sunlight - the perfect conditions for solar. Solar is not as unreliable as you think.\\n\\nAs well as that, Alex Epstein seemed to completely brush over the fact that if we do increase our use and dependence on fossil fuels, what do we do when they eventually, but surely, run out? That negative outweighs every other thing as you can't burn fossil fuels if there are none.   \n",

We are in the dark fort half the time when we lose heat more when no cloud and less when cloudy. So with only half warming  our real problem is to keep warm when we have the next solar minimum starting now and the next 5 years will be a total  V salute to alarmists who will be freezing  like half the world.   \n",

       "15615  here an interesting fact climate data in the u be generally collect at airport why because they be man 247 and must have current and reliable atmospheric data for aircraft operation so greatright well we be look at change in collected climate data change can be cause by multiple factor let look at a few move the airport denver have it only international airport within the city limit at one mile up in elevation and at the foothill of the rockies a very particular weather pattern prevail but then the airport be move it be now 20 mile to the east in the grassland those 20 mile make a very serious impact upon average temp the nw have a page devote to that fact because they be the federal organization that collect and aggregate all the climate data they point the starkdifference in data due to location change do that matter yes trend be base upon change so while temp in denver proper have stay the same the official temp for denverfrom the airport 20 mile awayhave increase but they havent the temp at that new site have remain relatively stabile development around airport hartsfield airport atlanta since it be open more than 50 year ago the airport have undergone a massive transformation from a regional airport with some national carrier capacity to one of the busy airport in the world it have also go from be a literal field airport in the countryside of atlanta to be a city unto itself with an area of about 35 square mile the vast majority of that be treeless and cover in cement and tarmac so this open country airport be now a heat sink expose to the hot georgia weather do that cause a massive change in official change in temp record at the airportobviously be that increase get bad a the airport expandsyes these be the change that have occur at just two of the hundred of official temperature data collection point in the u there be no water to correct for the change but they be use to show a trend of course the temp have increase in many locationsbut not allbecause the collection environment have be alter this be part of the shoddy science be employ in climate research earths climate could well be change for reason that be important but without solid data it be impossible to ever nail down the cause without that we can never select the correct mechanism to address it a an aside it be know that solar output have increase over the last 3 sunspot cycle if that be the actual cause then we need to know that in the last 15 year africa have lose over 260000 sq mile of forest due to purposeful deforestation that be a land area the size of texas in the previous 15 year it be twice that in south america deforestation have have exactly the same impact in central america loss over the last 30 year account for 60 of forested area madagascar have see the massive denuding of the moist temperate east coast desrtification have take hold rainfall have drop dramatically these be absolutely human induce effectsbut by the simple act of clear cut the forest that keep the climate stabile these massive impact alone be responsible for massive global climate variation but there be no discussion of themwhat so ever  \n",
