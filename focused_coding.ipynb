       "      <td>CO2 is a much smaller contributor to warming than water vapor. Climate models by the IPCC are terminally flawed. The warming is primarily driven by the solar flux changes combined with earth's orbital changes and axial processions. Earth's magnetic field is slowly weakening as it prepares to swap, solar winds now deposit more energy into the troposphere. Cloud formation is natural feedback increasing aldebo keeping temperatures lower. CO2 is far weaker than all of that and it lags temperature increases since the oceans will give up the gas as they warm. Humans contribute less than 5% of all CO2. Volcanos contribute as much as humans and ocean thermal vents and under ocean volcanos contribute more than that while the land and oceans contribute 90+ %. Most warming is NOT anthropogenic. They best studies with back testing show this. Say, 4% more CO2 which is logarithmic in its IR absorption can't possibly contribute enough.</td>\n",

       "      <td>There's a channel which features Space Weather on YouTube. It's called smAsho mAsh and I've been following it for a few years. The owner is a Solar Scientist and despite many claiming that the current Solar Cycle 25 is the minimum, he's been observing that the last cycle Solar Cycle 24 was actually the minimum and the data bears this out as we are already seeing far more sunspots than should be seen if this was a minimum.\\n\\nWhat this means is that the 20 year pause in temperatures was actually down to the advent of the Solar Minimum between December 2008 and the end in December 2019. Decreased solar activity also meant that there was less solar wind and Coronal Mass Ejections and this allowed the Cosmic Rays to increase the amount of cloud cover which cooled the planet through Cloud Condensation Nuclei allowing more clouds to form.\\n\\nIt's really very easy to see that Carbon Dioxide is not the only thing that changed since the Little Ice Age. Despite claims to the contrary, the increase of solar activity since the minimums over the last 600 years accounts for all the Global Warming that we've seen. Carbon Dioxide plays a minuscule part in the Climate when compared to water vapor and solar activity. \\n\\nJust recently there was a video on channel American Thought Leaders called \"Nobel Laureate John Clauser: Climate Models Miss Key Variable\" and he backs up that the missing piece of the Climate Models is CLOUDS.\\n\\nWho would have thought that William Wordsworth was a Climate Scientist?!</td>\n",

       "36106  theres a channel which features space weather on youtube its called smasho mash and ive been following it for a few years the owner is a solar scientist and despite many claiming that the current solar cycle 25 is the minimum hes been observing that the last cycle solar cycle 24 was actually the minimum and the data bears this out as we are already seeing far more sunspots than should be seen if this was a minimum what this means is that the 20 year pause in temperatures was actually down to the advent of the solar minimum between december 2008 and the end in december 2019 decreased solar activity also meant that there was less solar wind and coronal mass ejections and this allowed the cosmic rays to increase the amount of cloud cover which cooled the planet through cloud condensation nuclei allowing more clouds to form its really very easy to see that carbon dioxide is not the only thing that changed since the little ice age despite claims to the contrary the increase of solar activity since the minimums over the last 600 years accounts for all the global warming that weve seen carbon dioxide plays a minuscule part in the climate when compared to water vapor and solar activity just recently there was a video on channel american thought leaders called nobel laureate john clauser climate models miss key variable and he backs up that the missing piece of the climate models is clouds who would have thought that william wordsworth was a climate scientist   \n",

Climate models by the IPCC are terminally flawed. The warming is primarily driven by the solar flux changes combined with earth's orbital changes and axial processions. Earth's magnetic field is slowly weakening as it prepares to swap, solar winds now deposit more energy into the troposphere. Cloud formation is natural feedback increasing aldebo keeping temperatures lower. CO2 is far weaker than all of that and it lags temperature increases since the oceans will give up the gas as they warm. Humans contribute less than 5% of all CO2. Volcanos contribute as much as humans and ocean thermal vents and under ocean volcanos contribute more than that while the land and oceans contribute 90+ %. Most warming is NOT anthropogenic. They best studies with back testing show this. Say, 4% more CO2 which is logarithmic in its IR absorption can't possibly contribute enough.   \n",

Do you know what a climate model is? It is a vast simplification of the real world. You feed your model your simplistic assumptions and then it regurgitates a solution that seems “credible” to the model developer. Note the word credible. Credible means believable. Credible does not mean the truth. Climate models don’t create truth or valid climate predictions; they just deliver credible (believable to the climatologist) results. \\r\\nThe same holds true with virus propagation modeling. No truth, just credible results based on somebody's spurious opinion.   \n",

So presents this pseudo-model which creates a threatening-looking whirly sort of readout, which she asserts allows us to infer that there's going to be temperature rise, which will cost boatloads of money, as if the people who can't make computer models of climate, can make economic predictions any more than they can make climate predictions.   \n",

       "36106  There's a channel which features Space Weather on YouTube. It's called smAsho mAsh and I've been following it for a few years. The owner is a Solar Scientist and despite many claiming that the current Solar Cycle 25 is the minimum, he's been observing that the last cycle Solar Cycle 24 was actually the minimum and the data bears this out as we are already seeing far more sunspots than should be seen if this was a minimum.\\n\\nWhat this means is that the 20 year pause in temperatures was actually down to the advent of the Solar Minimum between December 2008 and the end in December 2019. Decreased solar activity also meant that there was less solar wind and Coronal Mass Ejections and this allowed the Cosmic Rays to increase the amount of cloud cover which cooled the planet through Cloud Condensation Nuclei allowing more clouds to form.\\n\\nIt's really very easy to see that Carbon Dioxide is not the only thing that changed since the Little Ice Age. Despite claims to the contrary, the increase of solar activity since the minimums over the last 600 years accounts for all the Global Warming that we've seen. Carbon Dioxide plays a minuscule part in the Climate when compared to water vapor and solar activity. \\n\\nJust recently there was a video on channel American Thought Leaders called \"Nobel Laureate John Clauser: Climate Models Miss Key Variable\" and he backs up that the missing piece of the Climate Models is CLOUDS.\\n\\nWho would have thought that William Wordsworth was a Climate Scientist?!   \n",

       "36106  there a channel which feature space weather on youtube it call smasho mash and ive be follow it for a few year the owner be a solar scientist and despite many claim that the current solar cycle 25 be the minimum he be observe that the last cycle solar cycle 24 be actually the minimum and the data bear this out a we be already see far more sunspot than should be see if this be a minimum what this mean be that the 20 year pause in temperature be actually down to the advent of the solar minimum between december 2008 and the end in december 2019 decrease solar activity also mean that there be less solar wind and coronal mass ejection and this allow the cosmic ray to increase the amount of cloud cover which cool the planet through cloud condensation nucleus allow more cloud to form it really very easy to see that carbon dioxide be not the only thing that change since the little ice age despite claim to the contrary the increase of solar activity since the minimum over the last 600 year account for all the global warming that weve see carbon dioxide play a minuscule part in the climate when compare to water vapor and solar activity just recently there be a video on channel american thought leader call nobel laureate john clauser climate model miss key variable and he back up that the miss piece of the climate model be cloud who would have think that william wordsworth be a climate scientist  "
