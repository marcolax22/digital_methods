species that has evolved from being aggressive to being non aggressive through our ancestors female nurturing of children and their protection of children by mating non aggressive males in favor of aggressive males the females were also very generous with sex as a stress reliver in situations that could turn violent so there was general harmony and the children were happy and safe from aggression it took 5 million years to convert males from aggressive to nonaggressive by selective mating and relieving stress by sexual generosity and during that period  amongst other changes of course  we volunteered to loosing our magnificent weapons  the canines because the smaller the canines you have the less aggressive you are obviously perceived by the females remember that gorillas maintaind their huge canines even though they only eat greenery fruit and berries when we became humans around 2 million years ago by acquiring the thinking capable appendix to our nonaggressive primate ancestor brain through mutations we ended up with a two part brain where both parts could control our body and behavior but non of these parts knew about the presence of the other part but they could feel the happiness or anxiety of the other through common hormones and neurotransmitters now we can realize that our instincts are of course all about our childrens safety and wellbeing but without violence and by using sexual pleasure as a stress reliever instead of violence when our cognitive appendix is behaving selfish and aggressive our instinctive major brain part get upset and release stress signals that are sensed by our thinkingcapable neurons and interpreted as doing something wrong we feel like someone is accusing us of being a bad person and we become defensive and angry because we dont understand why this pain is put on us and we also project that feeling upon others because it must be them that are accusing us and not ourselves this is a very upsetting state to live in that will generally make us dislike ourselves and think we are unworthy and evil and it can in worst case drive us insane psychotic schizophrenic depressed hyper selfharming or basically into any psychological trauma if it becomes sufficiently severe we are born wonderful and without prejudice and an empty thinkingcapable brain but as we grow up we experience the madness of our selfish and aggressive human condition which leads our instinctive brain into complete stress and the cognitive neurons receiving this stress is at the maximum pain during the cognitive immature years of puberty at that stage our ancestor major brain is potentially so upset that we need to terminate the pain literally or decide if we want to go the social route and only focus on basic matters and enjoy the uncomplicated life of mental simplicity or go for the route of soulless competition it is of course possible to chose anything inbetween and largely dependent on the environment you grow up in this is avoidable if we know why and we can therefore mitigate the stress by living in way that our instinctive neurons can approve of  which is being unselfish nonaggressive and nurturing but still make good use of our cognitive neurons to make life even better for all of our children and therefore for all of us there is another primate on this shouldbemuchmorebeautiful planet and its name is bonobo it lives on the shores of the congo river only i looks like a chimpanzee but it behaves very differently  especially in regard to violence and sex the bonobos are the only human comparable animal that practice sexual intercourse face to face and where the females are always sexually active and generous and only miniscule violence has ever been observed it is 987 genetically identical to humans and therefore only 13 different it is more similar to us than gorillas the reason for humans creating religions everywhere is obvious its an explanation of who we were before we got divided into two brain parts that didnt know about the existence of each other and therefore we became somewhat schizophrenicpsychoticupset depending on the violence and abuse in our upbringing religions are a way to tell us  at a developmental stage where we didnt know about genetics neurology evolutionary theory and other relevant subjects  that our instincts god  adam  eve are beautiful and we should be proud of them and follow their guidelines the commandments after 2 million years of human suffering the human condition from not understanding ourselves and how we evolved we can rest assured that we are indeed good unselfish and nonaggressive in natureinstinctively and the knowledge of that came from uncorrupted holistic science in theology neurology biochemistry biology psychology anthropology geology climatology archeology evolutionary theory and probably many more endeavors that humanity has set out on inorder to understand our place in the universe and ultimately in order to understand ourselves be proud of who we are and recognize how painful it has been to come to this place after 2 million years of accelerating mental suffering and finally be able to know that we are instinctively good unselfish and nonaggressive and we can now move forward by eliminating our fears of others ourselves and helping each other ourselves in becoming the truly self aware new mentally evolved humanity you can call it humanity 20 if you want where the happiness of children and thereby the happiness of everyone is at the center of all we do it will be too amazing to even contemplate but it can happen if we understand who we really are instinctively and cognitively let us free our brains from the guild of what we have done to ourselves in the past due to ignorance and nonselfawareness and lets make the future prosperous and plentiful with our newly acquired knowledge of how to become appease with our wonderful instincts by being smart but still nurturing we can do

al gores film which i call a very convenient lie cherry picking the worst data to push his left wing agenda because they are not given both sides of this argument they swallow this rubbish as gospel plimer is not alone the truth is out there do your own research and ignore the bullshine i cant remember the first time i heard that islands like the maldives would be under water in five years but it was at least fifty years ago today the maldives are both ramping up their tourism efforts whilst also claiming funding to prevent sea level riseif you cannot see the massive worldwide grift here then please wake up and smell the coffee when i went to skool i was taught how to think we had regular debates where we had to argue a viewpoint in direct opposition to that which we held it gave us an insight into two sides of an argument how to assemble information in order to decide for ourselves it required a reasoned assimilation of all relevant info this has been lost  education today is lowest common denominator level whats easiest to teach with the minimal effort required to hit left wing targets kids today are told what to think instead of how none of this is accidental imagine if you would a world where climatologists could predict what the climate would be in one hundred years when they cant even predict what it will be next week dont take my word dont listen to me do your own research there is climate change it changes every day and a miniscule amount is due to human activity   \n",
       "59097  thank you ralph and tom religion has its rightful place in human cognitive evolution from a bonobo like ape and we need to understand why we are like we are we are a socialsexual species that has evolved from being aggressive to being non aggressive through our ancestors female nurturing of children and their protection of children by mating non aggressive males in favor of aggressive males the females were also very generous with sex as a stress reliver in situations that could turn violent so there was general harmony and the children were happy and safe from aggression it took 5 million years to convert males from aggressive to nonaggressive by selective mating and relieving stress by sexual generosity and during that period  amongst other changes of course  we volunteered to loosing our magnificent weapons  the canines because the smaller the canines you have the less aggressive you are obviously perceived by the females remember that gorillas maintaind their huge canines even though they only eat greenery fruit and berries when we became humans around 2 million years ago by acquiring the thinking capable appendix to our nonaggressive primate ancestor brain through mutations we ended up with a two part brain where both parts could control our body and behavior but non of these parts knew about the presence of the other part but they could feel the happiness or anxiety of the other through common hormones and neurotransmitters now we can realize that our instincts are of course all about our childrens safety and wellbeing but without violence and by using sexual pleasure as a stress reliever instead of violence when our cognitive appendix is behaving selfish and aggressive our instinctive major brain part get upset and release stress signals that are sensed by our thinkingcapable neurons and interpreted as doing something wrong we feel like someone is accusing us of being a bad person and we become defensive and angry because we dont understand why this pain is put on us and we also project that feeling upon others because it must be them that are accusing us and not ourselves this is a very upsetting state to live in that will generally make us dislike ourselves and think we are unworthy and evil and it can in worst case drive us insane psychotic schizophrenic depressed hyper selfharming or basically into any psychological trauma if it becomes sufficiently severe we are born wonderful and without prejudice and an empty thinkingcapable brain but as we grow up we experience the madness of our selfish and aggressive human condition which leads our instinctive brain into complete stress and the cognitive neurons receiving this stress is at the maximum pain during the cognitive immature years of puberty at that stage our ancestor major brain is potentially so upset that we need to terminate the pain literally or decide if we want to go the social route and only focus on basic matters and enjoy the uncomplicated life of mental simplicity or go for the route of soulless competition it is of course possible to chose anything inbetween and largely dependent on the environment you grow up in this is avoidable if we know why and we can therefore mitigate the stress by living in way that our instinctive neurons can approve of  which is being unselfish nonaggressive and nurturing but still make good use of our cognitive neurons to make life even better for all of our children and therefore for all of us there is another primate on this shouldbemuchmorebeautiful planet and its name is bonobo it lives on the shores of the congo river only i looks like a chimpanzee but it behaves very differently  especially in regard to violence and sex the bonobos are the only human comparable animal that practice sexual intercourse face to face and where the females are always sexually active and generous and only miniscule violence has ever been observed it is 987 genetically identical to humans and therefore only 13 different it is more similar to us than gorillas the reason for humans creating religions everywhere is obvious its an explanation of who we were before we got divided into two brain parts that didnt know about the existence of each other and therefore we became somewhat schizophrenicpsychoticupset depending on the violence and abuse in our upbringing religions are a way to tell us  at a developmental stage where we didnt know about genetics neurology evolutionary theory and other relevant subjects  that our instincts god  adam  eve are beautiful and we should be proud of them and follow their guidelines the commandments after 2 million years of human suffering the human condition from not understanding ourselves and how we evolved we can rest assured that we are indeed good unselfish and nonaggressive in natureinstinctively and the knowledge of that came from uncorrupted holistic science in theology neurology biochemistry biology psychology anthropology geology climatology archeology evolutionary theory and probably many more endeavors that humanity has set out on inorder to understand our place in the universe and ultimately in order to understand ourselves be proud of who we are and recognize how painful it has been to come to this place after 2 million years of accelerating mental suffering and finally be able to know that we are instinctively good unselfish and nonaggressive and we can now move forward by eliminating our fears of others ourselves and helping each other ourselves in becoming the truly self aware new mentally evolved humanity you can call it humanity 20 if you want where the happiness of children and thereby the happiness of everyone is at the center of all we do it will be too amazing to even contemplate but it can happen if we understand who we really are instinctively and cognitively let us free our brains from the guild of what we have done to ourselves in the past due to ignorance and nonselfawareness and lets make the future prosperous and plentiful with our newly acquired knowledge of how to become appease with our wonderful instincts by being smart but still nurturing we can do anything and without fighting ourselves and others it will become astronomically more easy im not a native english speaker and i know i make mistakes but i hope you understand anyway peace  love

       "57729                      great observation i would like to add another evolutionary psychological theory that i think explains a lot about why we are so derailed we are a socialsexual

and then there is elon musks presentation by the way it is carbon dioxide not carbon excuse me while i pause for a glass of hydrogen a simple check on ice core analyses reveals that the oceans warm before aerial co2 rise the cart does not pull the horse also that most populated areas in europe and north america were under ice caps 15 000 years ago and it all melted without any human influence water vapour is by far the dominant greenhouse gas with carbon dioxide essentially irrelevant it was warmer in minoan roman and medeival times when co2 was lower and each of the subsequent peaks is becoming progressively cooler there is no correlation less than r coefficientof 1 over geological time between temperature and co2 aerial carbon dioxide is now much lower than throughout the planets history now at dangerous levels of around 400 ppm it only needs to go to 250ppm when photosynthesis stops and we all die carbon dioxide expressed by human activities is 1 part in a thousand percent of the air and its effective warming band is much the same as that of the totally dominant water vapour to believe implicitally that this miniscule component is the main driver of earths temperature defies belief how someone so rich and clever can hold the climate views that he presents is qute beyond me   \n",

“emissions” is frequently used in this interview which refers to trace greenhouse gases carbon dioxide 004 of the atmosphere methane 000017 of the atmosphere and nitrous oxide 000003 of the atmosphere we are led to believe that a rise in these miniscule gases will cause the planet to overheat and eventually kill humans and life to provide proof climate alarmists backed by mainstream media and certain politicians continuously claim that extreme weather events and rising temperatures are “unprecedented” another popular propaganda word many scientists have debunked these claims but their voices go unheard climate alarmists mainstream media and certain politicians ignore reasonable debate because they prefer fear mongering because this motivates people to give them money to fight the latest monster under the bed instead of talking about something that might kill people in the distant future why doesn’t mainstream media and politicians talk about all the things that are currently killing people such as gun violence drug overdoses auto accidents industrial accidents murders suicides and war   \n",

       "30933                                     we really are governed by insanity and we must know why here is a proposal that actually makes sense in my humble opinion we are a socialsexual species that has evolved from being aggressive to being non aggressive through our ancestors female nurturing of children and their protection of children by mating non aggressive males in favor of aggressive males the females were also very generous with sex as a stress reliver in situations that could turn violent so there was general harmony and the children were happy and safe from aggression it took 5 million years to convert males from aggressive to nonaggressive by selective mating and relieving stress by sexual generosity and during that period  amongst other changes of course  we volunteered to loosing our magnificent weapons  the canines because the smaller the canines you have the less aggressive you are obviously perceived by the females remember that gorillas maintaind their huge canines even though they only eat greenery fruit and berries when we became humans around 2 million years ago by acquiring the thinking capable appendix to our nonaggressive primate ancestor brain through mutations we ended up with a two part brain where both parts could control our body and behavior but non of these parts knew about the presence of the other part but they could feel the happiness or anxiety of the other through common hormones and neurotransmitters now we can realize that our instincts are of course all about our childrens safety and wellbeing but without violence and by using sexual pleasure as a stress reliever instead of violence when our cognitive appendix is behaving selfish and aggressive our instinctive major brain part get upset and release stress signals that are sensed by our thinkingcapable neurons and interpreted as doing something wrong we feel like someone is accusing us of being a bad person and we become defensive and angry because we dont understand why this pain is put on us and we also project that feeling upon others because it must be them that are accusing us and not ourselves this is a very upsetting state to live in that will generally make us dislike ourselves and think we are unworthy and evil and it can in worst case drive us insane psychotic schizophrenic depressed hyper selfharming or basically into any psychological trauma if it becomes sufficiently severe we are born wonderful and without prejudice and an empty thinkingcapable brain but as we grow up we experience the madness of our selfish and aggressive human condition which leads our instinctive brain into complete stress and the cognitive neurons receiving this stress is at the maximum pain during the cognitive immature years of puberty at that stage our ancestor major brain is potentially so upset that we need to terminate the pain literally or decide if we want to go the social route and only focus on basic matters and enjoy the uncomplicated life of mental simplicity or go for the route of soulless competition it is of course possible to chose anything inbetween and largely dependent on the environment you grow up in this is avoidable if we know why and we can therefore mitigate the stress by living in way that our instinctive neurons can approve of  which is being unselfish nonaggressive and nurturing but still make good use of our cognitive neurons to make life even better for all of our children and therefore for all of us there is another primate on this shouldbemuchmorebeautiful planet and its name is bonobo it lives on the shores of the congo river only i looks like a chimpanzee but it behaves very differently  especially in regard to violence and sex the bonobos are the only human comparable animal that practice sexual intercourse face to face and where the females are always sexually active and generous and only miniscule violence has ever been observed it is 987 genetically identical to humans and therefore only 13 different it is more similar to us than gorillas the reason for humans creating religions everywhere is obvious its an explanation of who we were before we got divided into two brain parts that didnt know about the existence of each other and therefore we became somewhat schizophrenicpsychoticupset depending on the violence and abuse in our upbringing religions are a way to tell us  at a developmental stage where we didnt know about genetics neurology evolutionary theory and other relevant subjects  that our instincts god  adam  eve are beautiful and we should be proud of them and follow their guidelines the commandments after 2 million years of human suffering the human condition from not understanding ourselves and how we evolved we can rest assured that we are indeed good unselfish and nonaggressive in natureinstinctively and the knowledge of that came from uncorrupted holistic science in theology neurology biochemistry biology psychology anthropology geology climatology archeology evolutionary theory and probably many more endeavors that humanity has set out on inorder to understand our place in the universe and ultimately in order to understand ourselves be proud of who we are and recognize how painful it has been to come to this place after 2 million years of accelerating mental suffering and finally be able to know that we are instinctively good unselfish and nonaggressive and we can now move forward by eliminating our fears of others ourselves and helping each other ourselves in becoming the truly self aware new mentally evolved humanity you can call it humanity 20 if you want where the happiness of children and thereby the happiness of everyone is at the center of all we do it will be too amazing to even contemplate but it can happen if we understand who we really are instinctively and cognitively let us free our brains from the guild of what we have done to ourselves in the past due to ignorance and nonselfawareness and lets make the future prosperous and plentiful with our newly acquired knowledge of how to become appease with our wonderful instincts by being smart but still nurturing we can do anything and without fighting ourselves and others it will become astronomically more easy im not a native english speaker and i know i make mistakes but i hope you understand anyway peace  love

agw are done through the socalled ghe but the ghe is but a small part of what affects the climate natural variability as seen in the past like the little ice age which we are warming up from now natural factors are variations in sun activity ocean currents volcanos underwater hot springs cosmic radiation clouds etc the ghgs are mainly water vapor 95 co2 4 of the tiny co2 in the atmosphere only 4 is human caused totally the co2 content in the atmosphere is about 400ppm a simple calculation 4001000000 x 4  00016 practically zero if we remove all of this miniscule 00016 co2 molecules from the atmosphere 96 of the natural co2 would still be there and given that the ghe is just a small part to begin with this sacrifice will have zero efect on the climate so taking all the world back to the stone age zero emissions you achieve zero of your initial goal btw nobody denies climate change   \n",

Cherry picking the worst data to push his left wing agenda. Because they are not given both sides of this argument, they  swallow this rubbish as gospel. Plimer is not alone, the truth is out there, do your own research and ignore the bullshine.\\nI can`t remember the first time I heard that islands like the Maldives would be under water in five years, but it was at least fifty years ago. Today the Maldives are both ramping up their tourism efforts whilst also claiming funding to prevent sea level rise.If you cannot see the massive worldwide grift here, then please wake up and smell the coffee.\\nWhen I went to skool, I was taught how to think, we had regular debates where we had to argue a viewpoint  in direct opposition to that which we held.\\nIt gave us an insight into two sides of an argument,  how to assemble information in order to decide for ourselves. It required a reasoned assimilation of all relevant info. \\nThis has been lost . \"Education'' today is lowest common denominator level. What`s easiest to \"teach'' with the minimal effort required to hit left wing targets.\\nKids today are told what to think instead of how.\\nNone of this is accidental, \\nImagine if you would, a world where \"climatologists\" could predict what the climate would be in one hundred years, when they can`t even predict what it will be next week.\\nDon`t take my word, don`t listen to me. Do  your own research.\\nThere is climate change, it changes every day and a miniscule amount is due to human activity.   \n",
       "59097  Thank you Ralph and Tom. Religion has its rightful place in human cognitive evolution from a bonobo like ape and we need to understand why we are like we are.\\nWe are a social-sexual species that has evolved from being aggressive to being non aggressive through our ancestors female nurturing of children and their protection of children by mating non aggressive males in favor of aggressive males. The females were also very generous with sex as a stress reliver in situations that could turn violent so there was general harmony and the children were happy and safe from aggression. It took 5 million years to convert males from aggressive to non-aggressive by selective mating and relieving stress by sexual generosity and during that period - amongst other changes of course - we \"volunteered\" to loosing our magnificent weapons - the canines, because the smaller the canines you have the less aggressive you are obviously perceived by the females. Remember that gorillas maintaind their huge canines even though they only eat greenery, fruit and berries.\\nWhen we became humans around 2 million years ago by acquiring the thinking capable appendix to our non-aggressive primate ancestor brain through mutations, we ended up with a two part brain where both parts could control our body and behavior but non of these parts knew about the presence of the other part but they could feel the happiness or anxiety of \"the other\" through common hormones and neurotransmitters. \\nNow we can realize that our instincts are of course all about our children's safety and well-being but without violence and by using sexual pleasure as a stress reliever instead of violence. \\nWhen our cognitive appendix is behaving selfish and aggressive our instinctive major brain part get upset and release stress signals that are sensed by our thinking-capable neurons and interpreted as doing something wrong. We feel like someone is accusing us of being a bad person and we become defensive and angry because we don't understand why this pain is put on us and we also project that feeling upon others because it must be them that are accusing us and not ourselves. This is a very upsetting state to live in that will generally make us dislike ourselves and think we are unworthy and evil and it can in worst case drive us insane, psychotic, schizophrenic, depressed, hyper, self-harming or basically into any psychological trauma if it becomes sufficiently severe. We are born wonderful and without prejudice and an empty thinking-capable brain but as we grow up we experience the madness of our selfish and aggressive human condition which leads our instinctive brain into complete stress and the cognitive neurons receiving this stress is at the maximum pain during the cognitive immature years of puberty. At that stage our ancestor major brain is potentially so upset that we need to terminate the pain literally or decide if we want to go the social route and only focus on basic matters and enjoy the uncomplicated life of mental simplicity or go for the route of soulless competition. It is of course possible to chose anything in-between and largely dependent on the environment you grow up in. This is avoidable if we know why and we can therefore mitigate the stress by living in way that our instinctive neurons can approve of - which is being unselfish, non-aggressive and nurturing but still make good use of our cognitive neurons to make life even better for all of our children and therefore for all of us.\\nThere is another primate on this should-be-much-more-beautiful planet and its name is Bonobo. It lives on the shores of the Congo river only. I looks like a chimpanzee but it behaves very differently - especially in regard to violence and sex. The Bonobos are the only human comparable animal that practice sexual intercourse face to face and where the females are always sexually active and generous and only miniscule violence has ever been observed. It is 98.7% genetically identical to humans and therefore only 1.3% different! It is more similar to us than gorillas!\\nThe reason for humans creating religions everywhere is obvious. It's an explanation of who we were before we got divided into two brain parts that didn't know about the existence of each other and therefore we became somewhat schizophrenic/psychotic/upset depending on the violence and abuse in our upbringing. Religions are a way to tell us - at a developmental stage where we didn't know about genetics, neurology, evolutionary theory and other relevant subjects -  that our instincts (God - Adam & Eve) are beautiful and we should be proud of them and follow their guidelines (the commandments). \\nAfter 2 million years of human suffering (the human condition) from not understanding ourselves and how we evolved, we can rest assured that we are indeed good, unselfish and non-aggressive in nature/instinctively and the knowledge of that came from uncorrupted holistic science in theology, neurology, biochemistry, biology, psychology, anthropology, geology, climatology, archeology, evolutionary theory and probably many more endeavors that humanity has set out on inorder to understand our place in the universe and ultimately in order to understand ourselves.\\nBe proud of who we are and recognize how painful it has been to come to this place after 2 million years of accelerating mental suffering and finally be able to know that we are instinctively good, unselfish and non-aggressive and we can now move forward by eliminating our fears of others (ourselves) and helping each other (ourselves) in becoming the truly self aware new mentally evolved humanity (you can call it humanity 2.0 if you want) where the happiness of children and thereby the happiness of everyone is at the center of all we do. It will be too amazing to even contemplate but it can happen if we understand who we really are instinctively and cognitively. Let us free our brains from the guild of what we have done to ourselves in the past due to ignorance and non-self-awareness and let's make the future prosperous and plentiful with our newly acquired knowledge of how to become appease with our wonderful instincts by being smart but still nurturing.\\nWe can do anything and without fighting ourselves and others it will become astronomically more easy.\\nI'm not a native English speaker and I know I make mistakes but I hope you understand anyway.\\nPEACE & LOVE   \n",

glass of hydrogen).\\n A simple check on ice core analyses reveals that the oceans warm before aerial CO2 rise (the cart does not pull the horse). Also, that most populated areas in Europe and North America were under ice  caps 15 000 years ago and it all melted without any human influence. \\nWater vapour is by far the dominant \"greenhouse\" gas with carbon dioxide essentially irrelevant. \\nIt was warmer in MInoan, Roman and Medeival times when CO2 was lower and each of the subsequent peaks is becoming progressively cooler. \\nThere is no correlation (less than r coefficientof 1) over geological time between temperature and CO2.\\nAerial carbon dioxide is now much lower than throughout the planet's history.  Now at dangerous levels of around 400 ppm. It only needs to go to 250ppm when photosynthesis stops and we all die.\\nCarbon dioxide expressed by human activities is 1 part in a thousand percent of  the air and its effective warming band is much the same as that of the totally dominant water vapour. To believe implicitally that this miniscule component is the main driver of Earth's temperature defies belief. \\nHow someone so rich and clever can hold the climate views that he presents, is qute beyond me.   \n",

atmosphere), methane (0.00017% of the atmosphere), and nitrous oxide (0.00003% of the atmosphere). We are led to believe that a rise in these miniscule gases will cause the planet to overheat and eventually kill humans and life. To provide proof, climate alarmists, backed by mainstream media and certain politicians, continuously claim that extreme weather events and rising temperatures are “unprecedented,” (another popular propaganda word). Many scientists have debunked these claims, but their voices go unheard. Climate alarmists, mainstream media, and certain politicians ignore reasonable debate because they prefer fear mongering, because this motivates people to give them money to fight the latest monster under the bed. Instead of talking about something that might kill people in the distant future, why doesn’t mainstream media and politicians talk about all the things that are currently killing people such as gun violence, drug overdoses, auto accidents, industrial accidents, murders, suicides, and war?   \n",

       "30933                                   We really are governed by insanity and we must know why. Here is a proposal that actually makes sense in my humble opinion:\\n\\nWe are a social-sexual species that has evolved from being aggressive to being non aggressive through our ancestors female nurturing of children and their protection of children by mating non aggressive males in favor of aggressive males. The females were also very generous with sex as a stress reliver in situations that could turn violent so there was general harmony and the children were happy and safe from aggression. It took 5 million years to convert males from aggressive to non-aggressive by selective mating and relieving stress by sexual generosity and during that period - amongst other changes of course - we \"volunteered\" to loosing our magnificent weapons - the canines, because the smaller the canines you have the less aggressive you are obviously perceived by the females. Remember that gorillas maintaind their huge canines even though they only eat greenery, fruit and berries.\\nWhen we became humans around 2 million years ago by acquiring the thinking capable appendix to our non-aggressive primate ancestor brain through mutations, we ended up with a two part brain where both parts could control our body and behavior but non of these parts knew about the presence of the other part but they could feel the happiness or anxiety of \"the other\" through common hormones and neurotransmitters. \\nNow we can realize that our instincts are of course all about our children's safety and well-being but without violence and by using sexual pleasure as a stress reliever instead of violence. \\nWhen our cognitive appendix is behaving selfish and aggressive our instinctive major brain part get upset and release stress signals that are sensed by our thinking-capable neurons and interpreted as doing something wrong. We feel like someone is accusing us of being a bad person and we become defensive and angry because we don't understand why this pain is put on us and we also project that feeling upon others because it must be them that are accusing us and not ourselves. This is a very upsetting state to live in that will generally make us dislike ourselves and think we are unworthy and evil and it can in worst case drive us insane, psychotic, schizophrenic, depressed, hyper, self-harming or basically into any psychological trauma if it becomes sufficiently severe. We are born wonderful and without prejudice and an empty thinking-capable brain but as we grow up we experience the madness of our selfish and aggressive human condition which leads our instinctive brain into complete stress and the cognitive neurons receiving this stress is at the maximum pain during the cognitive immature years of puberty. At that stage our ancestor major brain is potentially so upset that we need to terminate the pain literally or decide if we want to go the social route and only focus on basic matters and enjoy the uncomplicated life of mental simplicity or go for the route of soulless competition. It is of course possible to chose anything in-between and largely dependent on the environment you grow up in. This is avoidable if we know why and we can therefore mitigate the stress by living in way that our instinctive neurons can approve of - which is being unselfish, non-aggressive and nurturing but still make good use of our cognitive neurons to make life even better for all of our children and therefore for all of us.\\nThere is another primate on this should-be-much-more-beautiful planet and its name is Bonobo. It lives on the shores of the Congo river only. I looks like a chimpanzee but it behaves very differently - especially in regard to violence and sex. The Bonobos are the only human comparable animal that practice sexual intercourse face to face and where the females are always sexually active and generous and only miniscule violence has ever been observed. It is 98.7% genetically identical to humans and therefore only 1.3% different! It is more similar to us than gorillas!\\nThe reason for humans creating religions everywhere is obvious. It's an explanation of who we were before we got divided into two brain parts that didn't know about the existence of each other and therefore we became somewhat schizophrenic/psychotic/upset depending on the violence and abuse in our upbringing. Religions are a way to tell us - at a developmental stage where we didn't know about genetics, neurology, evolutionary theory and other relevant subjects -  that our instincts (God - Adam & Eve) are beautiful and we should be proud of them and follow their guidelines (the commandments). \\nAfter 2 million years of human suffering (the human condition) from not understanding ourselves and how we evolved, we can rest assured that we are indeed good, unselfish and non-aggressive in nature/instinctively and the knowledge of that came from uncorrupted holistic science in theology, neurology, biochemistry, biology, psychology, anthropology, geology, climatology, archeology, evolutionary theory and probably many more endeavors that humanity has set out on inorder to understand our place in the universe and ultimately in order to understand ourselves.\\nBe proud of who we are and recognize how painful it has been to come to this place after 2 million years of accelerating mental suffering and finally be able to know that we are instinctively good, unselfish and non-aggressive and we can now move forward by eliminating our fears of others (ourselves) and helping each other (ourselves) in becoming the truly self aware new mentally evolved humanity (you can call it humanity 2.0 if you want) where the happiness of children and thereby the happiness of everyone is at the center of all we do. It will be too amazing to even contemplate but it can happen if we understand who we really are instinctively and cognitively. Let us free our brains from the guild of what we have done to ourselves in the past due to ignorance and non-self-awareness and let's make the future prosperous and plentiful with our newly acquired knowledge of how to become appease with our wonderful instincts by being smart but still nurturing.\\nWe can do anything and without fighting ourselves and others it will become astronomically more easy.\\nI'm not a native English speaker and I know I make mistakes but I hope you understand anyway.\\nPEACE & LOVE   \n",

WARMING! We deny that the climate is controlled by humans. The alleged AGW are done through the so-called GHE. But the GHE is but a small part of what affects the climate. Natural variability as seen in the past, like the Little Ice Age, which we are warming up from now. Natural factors are variations in sun activity, ocean currents, volcanos, underwater hot springs, cosmic radiation, clouds, etc... \\r\\nThe GHGs are mainly water vapor (95%), CO2 (4%). Of the tiny CO2 in the atmosphere only 4% is human caused. Totally the CO2 content in the atmosphere is about 400ppm+. A simple calculation 400/1000,000 x 4% = 0,0016%.  (Practically zero.)\\r\\nIf we remove all of this miniscule 0,0016% CO2 molecules from the atmosphere 96% of the natural CO2 would still be there, and given that the GHE is just a small part to begin with this sacrifice will have ZERO EFECT on the climate. So taking all the world back to The Stone Age (zero emissions) you achieve zero of your initial goal.\\r\\nBTW. NOBODY DENIES CLIMATE CHANGE!   \n",

today have see be force feed al gore film which i call a very convenient lie cherry pick the bad data to push his left wing agenda because they be not give both side of this argument they swallow this rubbish a gospel plimer be not alone the truth be out there do your own research and ignore the bullshine i cant remember the first time i heard that island like the maldives would be under water in five year but it be at least fifty year ago today the maldives be both ramp up their tourism effort whilst also claim funding to prevent sea level riseif you can not see the massive worldwide grift here then please wake up and smell the coffee when i go to skool i be taught how to think we have regular debate where we have to argue a viewpoint in direct opposition to that which we hold it give u an insight into two side of an argument how to assemble information in order to decide for ourselves it require a reasoned assimilation of all relevant info this have be lose education today be low common denominator level whats easiest to teach with the minimal effort require to hit left wing target kid today be tell what to think instead of how none of this be accidental imagine if you would a world where climatologist could predict what the climate would be in one hundred year when they cant even predict what it will be next week dont take my word dont listen to me do your own research there be climate change it change every day and a miniscule amount be due to human activity  \n",
       "59097  thank you ralph and tom religion have it rightful place in human cognitive evolution from a bonobo like ape and we need to understand why we be like we be we be a socialsexual specie that have evolve from be aggressive to be non aggressive through our ancestor female nurturing of child and their protection of child by mat non aggressive male in favor of aggressive male the female be also very generous with sex a a stress reliver in situation that could turn violent so there be general harmony and the child be happy and safe from aggression it take 5 million year to convert male from aggressive to nonaggressive by selective mating and relieve stress by sexual generosity and during that period amongst other change of course we volunteer to loose our magnificent weapon the canine because the small the canine you have the less aggressive you be obviously perceive by the female remember that gorilla maintaind their huge canine even though they only eat greenery fruit and berry when we become human around 2 million year ago by acquire the thinking capable appendix to our nonaggressive primate ancestor brain through mutation we end up with a two part brain where both part could control our body and behavior but non of these part know about the presence of the other part but they could feel the happiness or anxiety of the other through common hormone and neurotransmitter now we can realize that our instinct be of course all about our childrens safety and wellbeing but without violence and by use sexual pleasure a a stress reliever instead of violence when our cognitive appendix be behave selfish and aggressive our instinctive major brain part get upset and release stress signal that be sense by our thinkingcapable neuron and interpret a do something wrong we feel like someone be accuse u of be a bad person and we become defensive and angry because we dont understand why this pain be put on u and we also project that feel upon others because it must be them that be accuse u and not ourselves this be a very upsetting state to live in that will generally make u dislike ourselves and think we be unworthy and evil and it can in bad case drive u insane psychotic schizophrenic depress hyper selfharming or basically into any psychological trauma if it become sufficiently severe we be bear wonderful and without prejudice and an empty thinkingcapable brain but a we grow up we experience the madness of our selfish and aggressive human condition which lead our instinctive brain into complete stress and the cognitive neuron receive this stress be at the maximum pain during the cognitive immature year of puberty at that stage our ancestor major brain be potentially so upset that we need to terminate the pain literally or decide if we want to go the social route and only focus on basic matter and enjoy the uncomplicated life of mental simplicity or go for the route of soulless competition it be of course possible to choose anything inbetween and largely dependent on the environment you grow up in this be avoidable if we know why and we can therefore mitigate the stress by live in way that our instinctive neuron can approve of which be be unselfish nonaggressive and nurturing but still make good use of our cognitive neuron to make life even well for all of our child and therefore for all of u there be another primate on this shouldbemuchmorebeautiful planet and it name be bonobo it live on the shore of the congo river only i look like a chimpanzee but it behave very differently especially in regard to violence and sex the bonobo be the only human comparable animal that practice sexual intercourse face to face and where the female be always sexually active and generous and only miniscule violence have ever be observe it be 987 genetically identical to human and therefore only 13 different it be more similar to u than gorillas the reason for human create religion everywhere be obvious it an explanation of who we be before we get divide into two brain part that didnt know about the existence of each other and therefore we become somewhat schizophrenicpsychoticupset depend on the violence and abuse in our upbringing religion be a way to tell u at a developmental stage where we didnt know about genetics neurology evolutionary theory and other relevant subject that our instinct god adam

can rest assure that we be indeed good unselfish and nonaggressive in natureinstinctively and the knowledge of that come from uncorrupted holistic science in theology neurology biochemistry biology

in order to understand ourselves be proud of who we be and recognize how painful it have be to come to this place after 2 million year of accelerate mental suffering and finally be able to know that

real climate science and then there be elon musk presentation by the way it be carbon dioxide not carbon excuse me while i pause for a glass of hydrogen a simple check on ice core analyse reveals that the ocean warm before aerial co2 rise the cart do not pull the horse also that most populated area in europe and north america be under ice cap 15 000 year ago and it all melt without any human influence water vapour be by far the dominant greenhouse gas with carbon dioxide essentially irrelevant it be warmer in minoan roman and medeival time when co2 be low and each of the subsequent peak be become progressively cooler there be no correlation less than r coefficientof 1 over geological time between temperature and co2 aerial carbon dioxide be now much low than throughout the planet history now at dangerous level of around 400 ppm it only need to go to 250ppm when photosynthesis stop and we all die carbon dioxide express by human activity be 1 part in a thousand percent of the air and it effective warming band be much the same a that of the totally dominant water vapour to believe implicitally that this miniscule component be the main driver of earths temperature defies belief how someone so rich and clever can hold the climate view that he present be qute beyond me  \n",

       "30933                                       we really be govern by insanity and we must know why here be a proposal that actually make sense in my humble opinion we be a socialsexual specie that have evolve from be aggressive to be non aggressive through our ancestor female nurturing of child and their protection of child by mat non aggressive male in favor of aggressive male the female be also very generous with sex a a stress reliver in situation that could turn violent so there be general harmony and the child be happy and safe from aggression it take 5 million year to convert male from aggressive to nonaggressive by selective mating and relieve stress by sexual generosity and during that period amongst other change of course we volunteer to loose our magnificent weapon the canine because the small the canine you have the less aggressive you be obviously perceive by the female remember that gorilla maintaind their huge canine even though they only eat greenery fruit and berry when we become human around 2 million year ago by acquire the thinking capable appendix to our nonaggressive primate ancestor brain through mutation we end up with a two part brain where both part could control our body and behavior but non of these part know about the presence of the other part but they could feel the happiness or anxiety of the other through common hormone and neurotransmitter now we can realize that our instinct be of course all about our childrens safety and wellbeing but without violence and by use sexual pleasure a a stress reliever instead of violence when our cognitive appendix be behave selfish and aggressive our instinctive major brain part get upset and release stress signal that be sense by our thinkingcapable neuron and interpret a do something wrong we feel like someone be accuse u of be a bad person and we become defensive and angry because we dont understand why this pain be put on u and we also project that feel upon others because it must be them that be accuse u and not ourselves this be a very upsetting state to live in that will generally make u dislike ourselves and think we be unworthy and evil and it can in bad case drive u insane psychotic schizophrenic depress hyper selfharming or basically into any psychological trauma if it become sufficiently severe we be bear wonderful and without prejudice and an empty thinkingcapable brain but a we grow up we experience the madness of our selfish and aggressive human condition which lead our instinctive brain into complete stress and the cognitive neuron receive this stress be at the maximum pain during the cognitive immature year of puberty at that stage our ancestor major brain be potentially so upset that we need to terminate the pain literally or decide if we want to go the social route and only focus on basic matter and enjoy the uncomplicated life of mental simplicity or go for the route of soulless competition it be of course possible to choose anything inbetween and largely dependent on the environment you grow up in this be avoidable if we know why and we can therefore mitigate the stress by live in way that our instinctive neuron can approve of which be be unselfish nonaggressive and nurturing but still make good use of our cognitive neuron to make life even well for all of our child and therefore for all of u there be another primate on this shouldbemuchmorebeautiful planet and it name be bonobo it live on the shore of the congo river only i look like a chimpanzee but it behave very differently especially in regard to violence and sex the bonobo be the only human comparable animal that practice sexual intercourse face to face and where the female be always sexually active and generous and only miniscule violence have ever be observe it be 987 genetically identical to human and therefore only 13 different it be more similar to u than gorillas the reason for human create religion everywhere be obvious it an explanation of who we be before we get divide into two brain part that didnt know about the existence of each other and therefore we become somewhat schizophrenicpsychoticupset depend on the violence and abuse in our upbringing religion be a way to tell u at a developmental stage where we didnt know about genetics neurology evolutionary theory and other relevant subject that our instinct god adam eve be beautiful and we should be proud of them and follow their guideline the commandment after 2 million year of human suffer the human condition from not understand ourselves and how we evolve we can rest assure that we be indeed good unselfish and nonaggressive in natureinstinctively and the knowledge of that come from uncorrupted holistic science in theology neurology biochemistry biology psychology anthropology geology climatology archeology evolutionary theory and probably many more endeavor that humanity have set out on inorder to understand our place in the universe and ultimately in order to understand ourselves be proud of who we be and recognize how painful it have be to come to this place after 2 million year of accelerate mental suffering and finally be able to know that we be instinctively good unselfish and nonaggressive and we can now move forward by eliminate our fear of others ourselves and help each other ourselves in become the truly self aware new mentally evolved humanity you can call it humanity 20 if you want where the happiness of child and thereby the happiness of everyone be at the center of all we do it will be too amazing to even contemplate but it can happen if we understand who we really be instinctively and cognitively let u free our brain from the guild of what we have do to ourselves in the past due to ignorance and nonselfawareness and let make the future prosperous and plentiful with our newly acquire knowledge of how to become appease with our wonderful instinct by be smart but still nurture we can do anything and without fight ourselves and others it will become astronomically more easy im not a native english speaker and i know i make mistake but i hope you understand anyway peace love  \n",

human the allege agw be do through the socalled ghe but the ghe be but a small part of what affect the climate natural variability a see in the past like the little ice age which we be warm up from now natural factor be variation in sun activity ocean current volcanos underwater hot spring cosmic radiation cloud etc the ghgs be mainly water vapor 95 co2 4 of the tiny co2 in the atmosphere only 4 be human cause totally the co2 content in the atmosphere be about 400ppm a simple calculation 4001000000 x 4 00016 practically zero if we remove all of this miniscule 00016 co2 molecule from the atmosphere 96 of the natural co2 would still be there and give that the ghe be just a small part to begin with this sacrifice will have zero efect on the climate so take all the world back to the stone age zero emission you achieve zero of your initial goal btw nobody deny climate change  "
