       "      <td>What is one scientist that is not button paid for Like I said before the 5 or 6 that agree that global warming is what they claim it is isn't 97% of scientists that Don't agree Is where there assumptions. And he is not the only scientist that doesn't With what husband said There are 3 others and the only reason why they aren't speaking up on this like they should is because They have grants that they don't want to have taken away from them on their research And they don't want recourses like that so this is why you're not hearing anything from the 97% of these scientists who are not agreeing with the whole climate global warming scenario that they're depicting. There are just way too many variables out there for it to be that easy. Like for example radio waves microwaves frequencies harp. And other countries that have this similar technology that are causing weather Warfare. And the capabilities of these equipment this is Quite conceivable what we're dealing with Is manipulation is Probably most likely what we are seeing the outtake of this Wild weather events earthquakes And droughts. Which makes everything look like but not completely true manufactured weather. Event. These are things that aren't factored into this equation. And these equipment is potentially dangerous if done wrong with heating the The ozone or atmosphebear if done incorrectly can have very Devastating effects. Are you going with scientists that are going back thousands of pounds thousands of years that are not Dealing with the 1st 400 years or less the findings are a little bit more Systematic With there Take on what global warming is They do agree that the Earth is getting warmer they do believe that the Warming climate is going on the downturn to cool. This also has consequences that could lead to another Ice age. Whether people want to admit it or not cars are actually preventing that Or slowing it down Might have something to do with keeping us from freezing. And it is very possible that the Earth is going to a cycle 10000 years or so it warms up it cools down . There is a rhythm that is natural. That our cars and what we have done in the past 200 years it's not even close to causing a crisis. I can't Thinning of the ozone I can't speak for the bombs that Are being tested that are destroying our ozone and the effects of that is probably catastrophic most likely. That is man made but it's not industries that are causing this Nature And some people want to cause problems for the rest of us and they should not have the power to do so that's simple. I am more concerned with Volcanoes that are active currently and there is more than just one around the world Today We have to be prepared for that. Not theories or concepts or writing the Coat tails and manipulating people to believing that there's a problem that is causing this global warming. When in fact we have nothing to do with that As much as people want to assume. If they had checked every variable that can be Possible double that is causing issues and to be prepared for is a better outcome than politics Getting in the way of our future. And I'm willing to put it out there that I guarantee you their version is not up to Par and it's all frivolous. No substance no idea that this electric cars are going to be any better is foolish on anyone Beliefs. Maybe if they stuck to recycling like they were supposed to we wouldn't have to worry about trash or things going into the ocean. Just maybe if they stuck with that things would be a little bit better Then it is today. But it's really hard to believe in When you can't remember what you fool the people on it And not Be responsible for the trash that is out there that could be recycled oh it cost too much well there are the ones that brought that up now didn't they. And they have not done anything to keep it legit or going for the better of the Earth or the environment. They like so much to people that they don't even know where to begin. But if the scientists That wish to speak up against this should have the right to do so without any consequences. Because the few that aren't speaking up and protecting this agenda is not good for all of us. So something either has to happen where the truth has to be revealed And not protect the people and government and hold those people accountable and remove them from the public once and for all. Protecting them isn't protecting us. That is in government.</td>\n",

       "14811  what is one scientist that is not button paid for like i said before the 5 or 6 that agree that global warming is what they claim it is isnt 97 of scientists that dont agree is where there assumptions and he is not the only scientist that doesnt with what husband said there are 3 others and the only reason why they arent speaking up on this like they should is because they have grants that they dont want to have taken away from them on their research and they dont want recourses like that so this is why youre not hearing anything from the 97 of these scientists who are not agreeing with the whole climate global warming scenario that theyre depicting there are just way too many variables out there for it to be that easy like for example radio waves microwaves frequencies harp and other countries that have this similar technology that are causing weather warfare and the capabilities of these equipment this is quite conceivable what were dealing with is manipulation is probably most likely what we are seeing the outtake of this wild weather events earthquakes and droughts which makes everything look like but not completely true manufactured weather event these are things that arent factored into this equation and these equipment is potentially dangerous if done wrong with heating the the ozone or atmosphebear if done incorrectly can have very devastating effects are you going with scientists that are going back thousands of pounds thousands of years that are not dealing with the 1st 400 years or less the findings are a little bit more systematic with there take on what global warming is they do agree that the earth is getting warmer they do believe that the warming climate is going on the downturn to cool this also has consequences that could lead to another ice age whether people want to admit it or not cars are actually preventing that or slowing it down might have something to do with keeping us from freezing and it is very possible that the earth is going to a cycle 10000 years or so it warms up it cools down  there is a rhythm that is natural that our cars and what we have done in the past 200 years its not even close to causing a crisis i cant thinning of the ozone i cant speak for the bombs that are being tested that are destroying our ozone and the effects of that is probably catastrophic most likely that is man made but its not industries that are causing this nature and some people want to cause problems for the rest of us and they should not have the power to do so thats simple i am more concerned with volcanoes that are active currently and there is more than just one around the world today we have to be prepared for that not theories or concepts or writing the coat tails and manipulating people to believing that theres a problem that is causing this global warming when in fact we have nothing to do with that as much as people want to assume if they had checked every variable that can be possible double that is causing issues and to be prepared for is a better outcome than politics getting in the way of our future and im willing to put it out there that i guarantee you their version is not up to par and its all frivolous no substance no idea that this electric cars are going to be any better is foolish on anyone beliefs maybe if they stuck to recycling like they were supposed to we wouldnt have to worry about trash or things going into the ocean just maybe if they stuck with that things would be a little bit better then it is today but its really hard to believe in when you cant remember what you fool the people on it and not be responsible for the trash that is out there that could be recycled oh it cost too much well there are the ones that brought that up now didnt they and they have not done anything to keep it legit or going for the better of the earth or the environment they like so much to people that they dont even know where to begin but if the scientists that wish to speak up against this should have the right to do so without any consequences because the few that arent speaking up and protecting this agenda is not good for all of us so something either has to happen where the truth has to be revealed and not protect the people and government and hold those people accountable and remove them from the public once and for all protecting them isnt protecting us that is in government   \n",

       "14811  What is one scientist that is not button paid for Like I said before the 5 or 6 that agree that global warming is what they claim it is isn't 97% of scientists that Don't agree Is where there assumptions. And he is not the only scientist that doesn't With what husband said There are 3 others and the only reason why they aren't speaking up on this like they should is because They have grants that they don't want to have taken away from them on their research And they don't want recourses like that so this is why you're not hearing anything from the 97% of these scientists who are not agreeing with the whole climate global warming scenario that they're depicting. There are just way too many variables out there for it to be that easy. Like for example radio waves microwaves frequencies harp. And other countries that have this similar technology that are causing weather Warfare. And the capabilities of these equipment this is Quite conceivable what we're dealing with Is manipulation is Probably most likely what we are seeing the outtake of this Wild weather events earthquakes And droughts. Which makes everything look like but not completely true manufactured weather. Event. These are things that aren't factored into this equation. And these equipment is potentially dangerous if done wrong with heating the The ozone or atmosphebear if done incorrectly can have very Devastating effects. Are you going with scientists that are going back thousands of pounds thousands of years that are not Dealing with the 1st 400 years or less the findings are a little bit more Systematic With there Take on what global warming is They do agree that the Earth is getting warmer they do believe that the Warming climate is going on the downturn to cool. This also has consequences that could lead to another Ice age. Whether people want to admit it or not cars are actually preventing that Or slowing it down Might have something to do with keeping us from freezing. And it is very possible that the Earth is going to a cycle 10000 years or so it warms up it cools down . There is a rhythm that is natural. That our cars and what we have done in the past 200 years it's not even close to causing a crisis. I can't Thinning of the ozone I can't speak for the bombs that Are being tested that are destroying our ozone and the effects of that is probably catastrophic most likely. That is man made but it's not industries that are causing this Nature And some people want to cause problems for the rest of us and they should not have the power to do so that's simple. I am more concerned with Volcanoes that are active currently and there is more than just one around the world Today We have to be prepared for that. Not theories or concepts or writing the Coat tails and manipulating people to believing that there's a problem that is causing this global warming. When in fact we have nothing to do with that As much as people want to assume. If they had checked every variable that can be Possible double that is causing issues and to be prepared for is a better outcome than politics Getting in the way of our future. And I'm willing to put it out there that I guarantee you their version is not up to Par and it's all frivolous. No substance no idea that this electric cars are going to be any better is foolish on anyone Beliefs. Maybe if they stuck to recycling like they were supposed to we wouldn't have to worry about trash or things going into the ocean. Just maybe if they stuck with that things would be a little bit better Then it is today. But it's really hard to believe in When you can't remember what you fool the people on it And not Be responsible for the trash that is out there that could be recycled oh it cost too much well there are the ones that brought that up now didn't they. And they have not done anything to keep it legit or going for the better of the Earth or the environment. They like so much to people that they don't even know where to begin. But if the scientists That wish to speak up against this should have the right to do so without any consequences. Because the few that aren't speaking up and protecting this agenda is not good for all of us. So something either has to happen where the truth has to be revealed And not protect the people and government and hold those people accountable and remove them from the public once and for all. Protecting them isn't protecting us. That is in government.   \n",

The problem is big potato companies cutting a bunch of land to grow crop and the government keep building huge cities. We have less trees now as we did during the early 20s. Trees take the earths carbon monoxide and turn it into oxygen. With out trees we wouldn’t exist.   \n",

How to imagine an abrupt rebound... If the atmosphere freezes more and more intensely, it eventually drops to the surface (water vapor freezes out). Eventually this results in global pressure drop. Pressure drop below certain limiting pressure allows sudden outgassing of the oceans. This outgassing happens more rapidly than the melting of ice or the sublimation of thick bodies of ice.\\n\\nQuite the spectacular scene. So... does this require animal life to hibernate underground for a period? Or is there another mechanism? Is the freezing out of all water enough to set this in motion?\\n\\nSomeone, please postpone incredulity and do the numbers and chemistry.\\n\\nNow....the opposite question. Why do atmospheres start cooling down sharply at the end of interglacials ?  Can a pressure increase (i.e. due to heat or lots of water vapor being suspended) suddenly create/trigger a cooling? If so, it would have applications in refrigeration systems. To the Google.   \n",

       "14811  what be one scientist that be not button pay for like i say before the 5 or 6 that agree that global warming be what they claim it be isnt 97 of scientist that dont agree be where there assumption and he be not the only scientist that doesnt with what husband say there be 3 others and the only reason why they arent speak up on this like they should be because they have grant that they dont want to have take away from them on their research and they dont want recourse like that so this be why youre not hear anything from the 97 of these scientist who be not agree with the whole climate global warming scenario that theyre depicting there be just way too many variable out there for it to be that easy like for example radio wave microwave frequency harp and other country that have this similar technology that be cause weather warfare and the capability of these equipment this be quite conceivable what be deal with be manipulation be probably most likely what we be see the outtake of this wild weather event earthquake and drought which make everything look like but not completely true manufacture weather event these be thing that arent factor into this equation and these equipment be potentially dangerous if do wrong with heat the the ozone or atmosphebear if do incorrectly can have very devastating effect be you go with scientist that be go back thousand of pound thousand of year that be not deal with the 1st 400 year or less the finding be a little bit more systematic with there take on what global warming be they do agree that the earth be get warmer they do believe that the warm climate be go on the downturn to cool this also have consequence that could lead to another ice age whether people want to admit it or not car be actually prevent that or slow it down might have something to do with keep u from freeze and it be very possible that the earth be go to a cycle 10000 year or so it warm up it cool down there be a rhythm that be natural that our car and what we have do in the past 200 year it not even close to cause a crisis i cant thinning of the ozone i cant speak for the bomb that be be test that be destroy our ozone and the effect of that be probably catastrophic most likely that be man make but it not industry that be cause this nature and some people want to cause problem for the rest of u and they should not have the power to do so thats simple i be more concerned with volcano that be active currently and there be more than just one around the world today we have to be prepare for that not theory or concept or write the coat tail and manipulate people to believe that theres a problem that be cause this global warming when in fact we have nothing to do with that as much a people want to assume if they have check every variable that can be possible double that be cause issue and to be prepare for be a good outcome than politics get in the way of our future and im willing to put it out there that i guarantee you their version be not up to par and it all frivolous no substance no idea that this electric car be go to be any good be foolish on anyone belief maybe if they stick to recycle like they be suppose to we wouldnt have to worry about trash or thing go into the ocean just maybe if they stick with that thing would be a little bit well then it be today but it really hard to believe in when you cant remember what you fool the people on it and not be responsible for the trash that be out there that could be recycle oh it cost too much well there be the one that bring that up now didnt they and they have not do anything to keep it legit or go for the good of the earth or the environment they like so much to people that they dont even know where to begin but if the scientist that wish to speak up against this should have the right to do so without any consequence because the few that arent speak up and protect this agenda be not good for all of u so something either have to happen where the truth have to be reveal and not protect the people and government and hold those people accountable and remove them from the public once and for all protect them isnt protect u that be in government  \n",
